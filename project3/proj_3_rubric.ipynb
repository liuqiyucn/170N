    "Imagine that you are playing a game with your friend in which you roll a 6-sided die.  The way the game works is that every time the die lands on side 1 or side 2, you win one dollar, and every time the die lands on side 3, 4, 5, or 6, your friend wins one dollar.  Because you really want to win the game at all costs, you decide to cheat and use a weighted die.  This means that the side is preferentially weighted so that sides 1 and 2 are each three times more likely to land face up than sides 3, 4, 5, and 6.  In other words, if $p_k$ denotes the probability that side $k$ will land face up, then\n",

The argument `num_steps` tells the simulation how many MCMC updates you want to perform.  The simulation should keep track of your winnings (an integer dollar amount) in the game after each update, and it should return the approximate expected value (average) of your earnings in the game.  Note that you should be able to figure out the expected value of your earnings analytically in this case and compare this to what your simulation produces as a sanity check.\n",

The inputs `temp` and `num_steps` specify the desired temperature of the lattice and the number of MCMC updates you wish to perform during the simulation.
