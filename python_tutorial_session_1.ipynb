Writing modular code makes it easier to plan and explain the logic of the code.  By breaking the code up into small pieces, each of which performs a specific function, one can focus on implementing each piece of code one at a time once the logic is layed out as opposed to having to think about the entire code all the time.  Also, when someone is trying to understand the code, they don't necessarily need to understand every line to get what it's doing, they'll just need to understand how all the various smaller pieces fit together.  If they want to delve into the nitty gritty implementation of each piece, they are free to do so, but they don't have to.\n","\n","Writing your own functions is a specific way of making code modular.  A function is an object that takes in certain inputs, does something potentially complicated to these inputs, and then returns an output.

The body of the function can contain any code you wish, and if you want the function to output a certain value, then that output is specified by the statement `return` followed by whatever you want the output to be.
