    "In the preceding program that printed out `Hello World!`, the text to be printed out had quotations around it.  In Python, text surrounded by quotations is called a **string**.  A string is actually a [**data type**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_type) in Python -- it's a way to specify and sometimes store a sequence of symbols.  Strings have many applications, but for our purposes in this tutorial, they will mainly be used to print out certain English statements at certain points in a program."

    "Perhaps the most fundamental thing one might want to use Python for in physical science applications is working with numbers.  \n",
    "\n",
    "What sorts of numbers can one work with in Python?  In this notebook, we will deal with three main numerical types:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **integers**\n",
    "    - Used to reprsent integers\n",
    "    - In python, integers are given the \"type\" `int`\n",
    "- **floating point numbers** aka **floats**\n",
    "    - Used to represent any real number to finite precision\n",
    "    - In python, floats are given the \"type\" `float`\n",
    "- **complex numbers** designated in Python as the type `complex`\n",
    "    - Used to represent complex numbers to finite precision\n",
    "    - In Python, complex numbers are given the \"type\" `complex`\n",
    "\n",
    "To type in an integer in python, you simply type out that number (in base 10 like you're used to) like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "    1377\n",
    "\n",
    "To type a float, you need to append a decimal point `.` to the end of the number so that the interpreter recognizes that you intend to type a float.  \n",
    "\n",
    "    1377.\n",
    "    \n",
    "You can include zeros after the decimal point like so if you wish,\n",
    "\n",
    "    1377.0\n",
    "\n",
    "but it's not necessary.  To specify a complex number, you need to specify its real and imaginary part.  The imaginary part must be written as a float immediately followed by the character `j` with no spaces because Python uses `j` for the imaginary unit that we often write as $i$ on a piece of paper.  For example, the imaginary number $i$ would be written as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "    1.0j\n",
    "    \n",
    "while the complex number $17+3i$ would be written as\n",

    "    17.0 + 3.0j\n",
    "    \n",
    "### When should each type of number be used?\n",
    "\n",
    "Whether you use an `int`, `float`, or `complex` in a given application should be based on the meaning of the quantity to which the number is assigning a value.  For example, the position of a particle moving in one dimension in classical mechanics can take any value on the real line, so in this case, it is appropriate to use a `float` to represent its value when you're doing computations in Python.  On the other hand, in quantum mechanics, when one is taking linear combinations of basis vectors in the state space of a system, the coefficients in this linear combination can in general be complex numbers, so in this case it would be appropriate to use the `complex` number type for these coefficients."

    "Essentially every nontrivial, useful algorithm that one wishes to implement on a computer takes advantage of the fact that a computer can execute instructions in succession very quickly, and therefore a computer is an ideal device for performing repetitive tasks.  For example, if you wanted to manually compute the sum of all numbers from 1 to 1000 by brute force addition, starting from 1 and adding 2 then adding 3 etc., this would take quite a while.  But for a computer, especially a modern computer, this is a piece of cake.  In order to do this sort of thing, it's often appropriate to use a **loop**.  In python, there are two main kinds of loops that one might generally find useful: **for loops**, which tell python to repeat a certain code block according to a pre-specified list of steps, and **while loops** which tell python to repeat a code block as long as a certain condition evaluates to true.\n",

    "When we want to re-use a certain piece of code, a convenient way to do so is to define a function.  We have already encountered certain functions that are built into python.  For example, we have seen that the `type` function takes some Python object (like an int or float) as its input and outputs what sort of object it is.  The `print` function takes some python expression as its input, and outputs the value of that expression.  There are lots of other functions built into Python that you can explore here, but we now want to discuss how a user can write his own Python functions."

    "Among the most important motivations for writing your own python functions is the goal of writing **modular** code.  This means writing code that comes in reasonably small pieces, each of which performs a specific task.  There are any advantages to writing modular code, among the most important are:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. If code is modular, then each segment of the code can be individually developed and dubugged before being used in an entire program.  This way, if the program isn't working properly, one can be reasonably certain that the properly debugged piece of code is not the culprit.\n",
    "2. If code is modular, then one can separate what a certain segment of code does from the precise implementation -- the way in which it accomplishes its tasks.  This means that if at a future date, one finds a better way of achieving that task, one needs only change an isolated piece of code with the new implementation instead of writing the whole thing over again.\n",
    "3. Writing modular code makes it easier to plan and explain the logic of the code.  By breaking the code up into small pieces, each of which performs a specific function, one can focus on implementing each piece of code one at a time once the logic is layed out as opposed to having to think about the entire code all the time.  Also, when someone is trying to understand the code, they don't necessarily need to understand every line to get what it's doing, they'll just need to understand how all the various smaller pieces fit together.  If they want to delve into the nitty gritty implementation of each piece, they are free to do so, but they don't have to.\n",
    "\n",
    "Writing your own functions is a specific way of making code modular.  A function is an object that takes in certain inputs, does something potentially complicated to these inputs, and then returns an output.  By writing a function to perform a task, you can use this function to perform that task again and again without having to copy and paste the full code for each instance of the task."

The word `def` is then followed by a single space and then the name of the function.  Adjoined to the name of the function are a set of parenthesis that enclose the labels one wishes to use for the argument(s) of the function, and a colon follows.  After the colon, one needs to go to the next line, and indent four spaces to tell the interpreter what's in the body of the function.  The body of the function can contain any code you wish, and if you want the function to output a certain value, then that output is specified by the statement `return` followed by whatever you want the output to be.  Note that a function does not need to return anything, so one can leave the return statement blank.\n",
