To create and use a module simply:\n","\n","1. Create a python (.py) file with the functions you'll want to import\n","1. Import the module the way you would import numpy or scipy\n","1. Call functions from the module\n","\n","For example, I could create a module called `my_module.py` that contains a function called `fun` that takes floats as inputs.  Then, when I want to use the function from that module within another python file or jupyter notebook, I would execute the following code to import the module:\n","\n","    import my_module\n","    \n","Then I would execute the following to call the function and evaluate on the float `3.0`\n","    \n","    my_module.fun(3.0)\n","    \n","Alternatively, I could alias the module if I want to work with a shorter name:\n","\n","    import my_module as mm\n","    mm.fun(3.0)\n","    \n","or I could import the function I want from the module so that I can avoid pre-pending the name of the module to the name of the function every time I want to call it:\n","\n","    from my_module import fun\n","    fun(3.0)\n","\n","Note that once a module is imported, the functions therein will be available from that point on, so you don't need to import the module more than once.\\*  It's a good idea to import all modules you will be using at the top of the python file or notebook you're currently working in.\n","\n","\\* An exception is when you've made changes to the module.

You can create a .py file from the Jupyter dashboard (looks like a list of files) by going to New -> Text File, and naming the new file to have the .py extension. You can also work with a regular ipynb file and save it as a python file  from the \"File\" -> \"Download as\" -> \"Python (.py)\" menu option.\n","- In this notebook, many of the problems ask you to write functions to accomplish certain taks.  Each of these functions should ultimately be located in the module you create whose filename is `python_problem_set.py`.\n","- Make sure the functions you write are put in the same sequence as the problems themselves for easy code review, and put a one-line comment preceding each function that serves to identify which functions are for which problems.\n","- Include a docstring for each function.  You might consider reading [this stackexchange post](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3898572/what-is-the-standard-python-docstring-format) to familiarize yourself with various standard styles for docstrings.\n","- Along with the module whose filename is `python_problem_set.py`, you will be asked to turn in a Jupyter notebook in which the module you create is imported, and the functions it contains are tested and used in the way described in the problems.  Write enough detail in your notebook so that it convincingly demonstrates that you've done the problems correctly.  In most cases, this means doing some testing to show that your functions are working properly.
